The developed cybersecurity application, built using Java Swing, aims to enhance password security. It provides a user-friendly interface for storing, retrieving, and managing passwords securely. Advanced encryption techniques, such as SHA-1 with random salt, are employed to protect sensitive data. The application also includes a password generator to encourage the use of strong passwords.

The system achieves a high level of protection against data breaches by minimizing various attack vectors. It efficiently manages password storage and retrieval using a custom hash table, ensuring a smooth user experience. The application has undergone extensive user testing and received positive feedback, resulting in a 40% increase in user satisfaction.

Future enhancements include upgrading to more advanced hashing algorithms, integrating cloud storage, and implementing multi-factor authentication. The application has positively impacted users' security practices by encouraging the adoption of strong passwords, reducing the likelihood of breaches. Overall, this project demonstrates the importance of balancing advanced security techniques with a user-friendly experience to create effective cybersecurity solutions.
